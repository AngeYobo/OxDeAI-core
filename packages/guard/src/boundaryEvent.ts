/**
 * Unified guard-boundary audit emission (#235).
 *
 * `onDecision` reports a completed `GuardDecisionRecord`. It therefore cannot
 * report a request the guard refused without emitting one — an unbranded
 * trusted context, a provenance conflict, a delegation replay, a state-hash
 * mismatch, a CAS conflict. Those rejections were previously visible only as a
 * thrown error, so a deployment whose only audit sink was `onDecision` could
 * not see attempted identity or tool substitutions at all.
 *
 * "No decision record" is not the same as "no decision". A boundary rejection
 * may occur before the engine ran (`policyEvaluated === false`), or after it
 * returned a valid ALLOW (`policyEvaluated === true`): authorization
 * verification, replay consumption, hash binding and the CAS commit all run
 * after the ALLOW and before `execute()`. On the ALLOW path `onDecision` fires
 * only once the protected callback has returned, so a rejection anywhere in
 * that window yields a boundary event and no decision record at all.
 *
 * This module carries the second stream. Every rejection raised at the guard
 * boundary is emitted once, as a structured {@link GuardBoundaryAuditEvent},
 * to the optional `onBoundaryEvent` hook — without changing any error type,
 * message, or control flow.
 *
 * ## Stream semantics (disjoint by construction)
 *
 * ```text
 * valid DENY                              → onDecision only      (decision record emitted)
 * guard rejection before execute() starts → onBoundaryEvent only (no decision record)
 * ALLOW, execute() starts, callback threw → neither              (current contract, #238)
 * ```
 *
 * The invariant is that no single rejection is ever reported on both streams.
 * A valid `OxDeAIDenyError` is the engine's decision, is reported to
 * `onDecision`, and returns early here; every other guard-boundary rejection
 * emits no decision record, whether or not the engine had already returned an
 * ALLOW. A malformed DENY — one whose `reasons` fail the guard's structural
 * check before `OxDeAIDenyError` is constructed (#247) — is not a decision:
 * it never reaches `onDecision`, is classified `POLICY_EVALUATION` /
 * `ENGINE_FAILURE` at the throw site, and is reported here like any other
 * pre-execution guard-boundary rejection.
 *
 * ## Failure contract
 *
 * `onBoundaryEvent` is a best-effort audit sink. A hook that throws, rejects,
 * or hangs on a rejected promise must never change what the caller sees: the
 * ORIGINAL error is always re-thrown, unwrapped and unreplaced. A deployment
 * that needs delivery guarantees must provide them inside the hook.
