/**
 * Tier 1 secure guard entry point.
 *
 * The secure path differs from {@link OxDeAIGuard} in exactly one respect: how
 * the evaluated intent's provenance is established. Everything after that —
 * state read, evaluation, authorization verification, replay consumption,
 * intent/state hash binding, CAS, execution ordering — is the SAME enforcement
 * body, reached by delegating to `OxDeAIGuard` rather than by reimplementing
 * it. Two entry points that share one body cannot drift apart.
 *
 * ```text
 * authenticate                       (caller, before this function)
 * → resolve trusted context          (createTrustedExecutionContext)
 * → normalize proposal → reconcile   (here; conflicts fail closed)
 * → read state → evaluate → verify → CAS → execute   (shared body)
 * ```
 *
 * Trusted context is a separate positional argument and never a field on
 * {@link ProposedAction}: there is no place to put it in the request payload,
 * so "trusted context is not accepted from request JSON" holds structurally
 * rather than by convention.
 *
 * ⚠️ Only this path, or an integration independently enforcing the same
 * boundary, may claim Tier 1 evaluator-input provenance. `OxDeAIGuard` remains
 * available and unchanged, and carries no such guarantee.
 *
 * SCOPE — this entry point establishes trusted *evaluator inputs* only. It does
 * NOT make state or policy authoritative: `getState` / `setState` and the
 * engine's policy configuration are still supplied by the deployment. An
 * authoritative versioned StateProvider and PolicyProvider are separate work.
 *
 * ⚠️ AUDIT CONTRACT — where provenance appears:
 *
 * ```text
 * ALLOW / evaluated paths      → provenance on GuardDecisionRecord (onDecision)
 * pre-evaluation conflict      → provenance on OxDeAIProvenanceConflictError,
 *                                NOT on onDecision
 * ```
 *
 * A provenance conflict is rejected before the shared enforcement body reaches
 * a policy decision, so there is no decision record to attach it to. It is
 * deliberately NOT emitted through `onDecision` as a synthetic DENY: that hook
 * reports `PolicyEngine` decisions, and manufacturing one would misreport a
 * boundary rejection as a policy outcome. **A deployment using `onDecision` as
 * its only audit sink will therefore not see attempted identity or tool
 * substitutions** — it must also record `OxDeAIProvenanceConflictError`, which
 * carries the conflicting fields and the full provenance map. Unified
 * guard-boundary audit emission is separate work.
